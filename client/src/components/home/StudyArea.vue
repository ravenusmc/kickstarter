           The purpose of the first chart is to show the user the number of charts
           that have failed, succeeded or been cancelled in a given time frame. The
           user can also select a money goal that they want to go up to as well as
           the number of backers who want to support a project.

         <p class='paragraphFormatting'>
           The reason why I created this chart is that I wanted the users to get
           just a basic information from the kickstarter data that I have. I also
           want to say that some of the filters from above will not be used to build
           this first chart.
